# üå± EcoEnergyOptimizer

**EcoEnergyOptimizer** is a lightweight, open-source Python project designed to promote sustainability and environmental awareness in the energy sector. It allows users to calculate their estimated carbon emissions based on monthly energy consumption and energy source, such as coal, natural gas, solar, wind, or hydro. The program then provides personalized suggestions for greener alternatives and calculates how much CO‚ÇÇ emissions can be reduced by switching to renewable energy sources. With just a few inputs, users can gain insight into their environmental impact and understand how transitioning to cleaner energy options can significantly lower their carbon footprint.

This project aims to encourage individuals and organizations to make more sustainable choices through simple data-driven insights. It is fully contained in a single Python file and runs seamlessly on any online compiler without the need for additional installations or dependencies. The simplicity and accessibility of EcoEnergyOptimizer make it a great starting point for beginners in sustainability analytics and environmental data science.

As part of Hacktoberfest, this project is open to collaboration and contributions. Developers, data enthusiasts, and sustainability advocates are encouraged to enhance the tool by adding features such as energy cost estimation, regional emission comparisons, or visual data analysis. Together, we can build a greener and more energy-efficient future through technology and awareness.
